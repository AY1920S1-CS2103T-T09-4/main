== Introduction
Seller Manager Lite (SML) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their sales*. More importantly, SML is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SML can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start
