== PROJECT: Seller Manager Lite (SML)

---

== Overview

Seller Manager Lite (SML) is a desktop application used for handphone resellers to manage their customers, phones, orders and schedules. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 28 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *GUI to display schedules in a calendar.*
** What it does: allows the user to view schedules graphically, as well as navigate around the calendar after adding/editing/deleting schedules.
** Justification: This feature is a critical addition for sellers who have numerous schedules planned throughout the week. Without a visual representation of a calendar, it would be extremely non-user-friendly as sellers would have to check through their list of schedules and the timings one by one.
** Highlights: I designed a class to contain the third-party library for rendering events as a calendar. The class acts as a wrapper around the calendar and contains the logic for controlling the calendar. I implemented the controls needed for navigating around the calendar GUI.
** Credits: _JFXtras_ for calendar display.

* *Minor enhancement*: Schedule commands to complement the calendar display.
