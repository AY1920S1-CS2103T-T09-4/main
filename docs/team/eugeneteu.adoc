== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *ability to generate statistics*
** What it does: allows the user to query total `Revenue`, `Cost` and `profit` on all past orders. Contains 2 types of input mode: 
 *** No date input: This mode is to give users a quick way of obtaining the numbers 
 *** Date input: This mode is to produce a monthly chart view of the statistics
 
** Justification: Being business owners, this feature should be very essential for the owners to be able to track their statistics and numbers while running their day to day operations. This allows them to more easily plan and monitor their business while using these numbers.
** Highlights: This feature cut across several layers in the entire projecet e.g logic, UI, model and hence desiging it in such a way that it was able to work with the existing Model View Controller architecture was a very important albeit tedious step. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
*** The implementation was also challenging as I made very sure no to violate any of the SOLID principles.

** Credits: The [apache commons math libraries](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/) was used in the actual calculation. However, the main difficulty of this feature does not come from the actual calculation but extracting the correct and appropiate data needed for this in the appropiate manner.  

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
