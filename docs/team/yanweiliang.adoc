== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to autocomplete commands*
** What it does: allows the user to input commands with ease. As the user enters input, suggestions will be shown.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user does not need to remember what commands are available or constantly refer to the user guide.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _UI code for displaying a dropdown menu was inspired by this StackOverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36861056/javafx-textfield-auto-suggestions_

* *Minor enhancement*: Planned how objects in the model should be designed and interact with each other.
